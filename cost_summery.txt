Reduced Budget Scenario :

By reducing the capacity and performance of compute resources, costs can be lowered without removing critical components necessary for the architecture to function.


Increased Budget Scenario :

These changes focus on increasing the system's ability to handle more traffic and providing better redundancy for failover, ensuring higher availability and better performance.
